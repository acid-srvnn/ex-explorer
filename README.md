# ex-explorer

An Extra Explorer for VS Code

* Highly lightweight
* Only minimal and most required features to be added
* Doesnt AutoRefresh
* I use it personally for listing log files in separate explorer

* New - Option to store and quick open favourite VsCode projects

Feature requests are welcome
